# Important notes
*In branch [new_version](https://github.com/yining043/VRP-DACT/tree/new_version), we have fixed some inaccuracies in the calculation of the feasibility masks for CVRP. As a result, the updated DACT (for CVRP) has shown a much faster training speed and much better performance. We keep this old_version for archival purposes.*
